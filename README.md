SOFTWARE DESIGN PATTERNS


You must include a readme file (a simple text file, either .txt or .md) listing what CPA issues you have solved and where in the code you did so. If you have made any assumptions in your work, or if your code requires anything in particular (like external dependencies/libraries) you should list them here also.
